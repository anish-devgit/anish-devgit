# Building reliable software that scales with people, not just users.

---

I focus on designing and shipping software that stays readable, maintainable, and calm under pressure.  
Most of my work revolves around turning vague problems into clear systems — then refining them until they disappear into reliability.

I avoid over-engineering, chase clarity, and care deeply about how code feels six months later.

## What I work with

**When reliability matters**
- JavaScript / TypeScript  
- React, modern CSS architectures  
- Git, GitHub workflows, clean commit history  

**When structure matters**
- Component-driven UI systems  
- State management with intent  
- Clear separation of concerns  

**When things break**
- Debugging production issues  
- Reading unfamiliar codebases  
- Fixing root causes, not symptoms

## Open source & collaboration

I contribute by improving existing systems rather than rewriting them.  
That usually means fixing edge cases, clarifying logic, reducing complexity, and respecting the original design decisions of maintainers.

I value thoughtful pull requests, small diffs, and code that’s written for the next person — not just the compiler.

## Selected work

**[ReactAtom](https://reactatoms.vercel.app/)**  
A focused solution built to escape dependency hell without unnecessary abstractions.  
Notable for its copy-paste simplicity and zero-runtime overhead.

**[Zenith Studio](https://zenith-interactive.vercel.app/)**  
Designed with performance and fidelity in mind, prioritizing frame-perfect interaction over clever shortcuts.

**[MacOS Web](https://macbook-landing-inky.vercel.app/)**  
An experiment in clean architecture and complex state management, refined through iteration.

## Engineering notes

- Readability compounds faster than cleverness  
- Refactoring is part of development, not a phase  
- If it’s hard to explain, it’s not finished  
- Good defaults prevent bad decisions  
- Code is communication first, execution second
